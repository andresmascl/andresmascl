## What I am currently working on
#### Ministry of Labor of Chile:

I currently work for the Ministry of Labor of Chile as a Data Analysis Development Consultant.

#### Licitaciones24x7.cl:
I also continue to work on my app [Licitaciones24x7.cl](https://licitaciones24x7.cl), a SaaS which serves market information to companies which participate in public tenders to provide services and goods to the Chilean government :chile:.

As a byproduct, Licitaciones24x7.cl generates as a list ranking the government units which call for these tenders.  The ranking compares their propensity to publish tenders which don't end up in purchases, to receive complains for malpractices during the tenders, and to receive complains for delayed payments of invoices.  See the ranking [here](https://info.licitaciones24x7.cl/demandantes-del-estado).




## Proyects I have worked on in the past
#### The SOLAB Survey (Sistema de Oportunidades Laborales):
- My most recent project was the design and development of the backend for [this report](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/eafa83fa-3faf-4955-a9bf-fb4fc38095c7) for the Ministry of Labor (also helped with the elaboration of some of the charts) which aims at anticipating the demand for job openings in the construction sector in different regions of the country based on surveys made to construction companies which have just obtained contracts with the government.  The results of the surveys are fed every week to a MySQL database using a python script which lives in a Colab Notebook and cleans and preprocesses the data.  The script also connects to a mailing service which sends out alerts to regional government recruiting agencies to let them know when there are companies in their region who need assistance recruiting for jobs.  The MySQL database is then connected to Google Data Studio for reporting.  Originally it was an internal project, and was meant to be seen only by the Ministry's officials, so I am very lucky that they decided to make it public, because it means I can add it to my portfolio!.  In some cases the contact information needed to reach the companies to be surveyed is provided by [Licitaciones24x7.cl's](https://licitaciones24x7.cl) internal API using a special node just for this.

#### Destinoempleo.cl:
- I proudly helped to plan the structure and design the charts of [Destinoempleo.cl](https://destinoempleo.cl) for the Ministry of Labor of Chile.  The sites' objective is to provide useful information to participants of the Chilean labor market in order to make better and more informed decisions regarding their career paths.  It was even featured on the local news! ![Destinoempleo on tv](https://i.imgur.com/KEptQrp.jpg)

- Back in 2018 I built a bot which downloaded information from Laborum.com in order to gather information for a research on the Chilean labor market.  The bot was built entirely inside a Google Colab Notebook, which is pretty neat because ultimately it's extracting data from a source rendering JavaScript inside a remote Jupyter notebook.  Here is [the link to the repo](https://github.com/andresmascl/LaborumSpyder).

- I will share more projects in the future as I find them in my computer or in older machines..
