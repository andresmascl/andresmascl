Welcome to my profile.

I am currently working in [Licitaciones24x7.cl](https://licitaciones24x7.cl), a SaaS which serves companies participating in public tenders to provide services and goods to Chilean government units.

As a byproduct, Licitaciones24x7.cl generates as a list ranking the Chilean government units which participate in these public tenders.  The ranking compares their propensity to publish tenders which don't end up in purchases, to receive complains for malpractices during their tenders, to receive complains for delayed payments of issued invoices.  See the list [here](https://info.licitaciones24x7.cl/demandantes-del-estado)
