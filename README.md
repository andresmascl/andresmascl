# Welcome to my profile!




#### What I am currently working on:

I am currently working on [Licitaciones24x7.cl](https://licitaciones24x7.cl), a SaaS which serves market information to companies which participate in public tenders to provide services and goods to the Chilean government :chile:.

As a byproduct, Licitaciones24x7.cl generates as a list ranking the government units which publish these tenders.  The ranking compares their propensity to publish tenders which don't end up in purchases, to receive complains for malpractices during the tenders, and to receive complains for delayed payments of invoices.  See the list [here](https://info.licitaciones24x7.cl/demandantes-del-estado)




#### Proyects I have worked on in the past:
- My most recent contribution to the Ministry of Labor of Chile was the design and development of the backend for {this report}(https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/eafa83fa-3faf-4955-a9bf-fb4fc38095c7) which aims at anticipating the demand for job openings in different regions of the country, based on surveys made to companies which have recently obtained building contracts with the government.  The results of the surveys are fed every week to the database using a python script which cleans and preprocesses the data.  Then connected to Google Data Studio using a data source connection.  Originally it was a private project, and was meant to be seen only by the Ministry's officials, so I am very lucky that they decided to make it public, because it means I can add it to my profile!
- I proudly helped to plan and design [Destinoempleo.cl](https://destinoempleo.cl) for the Ministry of Labor of Chile.  The sites' objective is to provide useful information to participants of the Chilean labor market in order to make better and more informed decisions regarding their career paths.
