# Welcome to my profile!

I am currently working in [Licitaciones24x7.cl](https://licitaciones24x7.cl), a SaaS which serves companies which participate in public tenders to provide services and goods to the Chilean government.

As a byproduct, Licitaciones24x7.cl generates as a list ranking the government units which publish these tenders.  The ranking compares their propensity to publish tenders which don't end up in purchases, to receive complains for malpractices during the tenders, and to receive complains for delayed payments of invoices.  See the list [here](https://info.licitaciones24x7.cl/demandantes-del-estado)


###### Proyects I have worked in the past:
-I proudly helped to plan and design the structure of [Destinoempleo.cl](https://destinoempleo.cl) for the Ministry of Labor of Chile
